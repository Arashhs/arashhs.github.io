  abstract={The Wearables for Health Toolkit (W4H Toolkit) is an open-source platform that provides a robust, end-to-end solution for the centralized management and analysis of wearable data. With integrated tools and frameworks, the toolkit facilitates seamless data acquisition, integration, storage, analysis, and visualization of both stored and streaming data from various wearable devices. The W4H Toolkit is designed to provide medical researchers and health practitioners with a unified framework that enables the analysis of health-related data for various clinical applications. We provide an overview of the system and demonstrate how it can be used by health researchers to import and analyze a wide range of wearable data and perform data analysis, highlighting the versatility and functionality of the system across diverse healthcare domains and applications.}
