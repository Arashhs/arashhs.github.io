      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and Analysis of a Secure Smart-Card-Based Healthcare System&lt;/strong&gt;
The research consists of 2 main parts, the investigation of smart card architectures and modeling security threats in an Electronic Healthcare System. A functional system architecture has been proposed to address these security threats which specifies a smart-card-based authentication method. The research was conducted in the Spring and Summer of 2020 for my Research Method and Technical Presentation course (which includes both Written and Oral Presentations).&lt;/p&gt;
